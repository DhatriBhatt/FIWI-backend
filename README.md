INTRODUCTION
The Caribbean Events Calendar App project aims to create a comprehensive Android application for users to discover, explore, and engage with Caribbean-based events and activities across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and Southern Ontario. This document outlines the scope of the project, including the project's purpose and justification, detailed scope description, high-level requirements, boundaries, strategy, deliverables, acceptance criteria, constraints, cost estimate, and cost-benefit analysis.

PROJECT PURPOSE AND JUSTIFICATION
The purpose of the Caribbean Events Calendar App project is to create a comprehensive Android application that enables users to discover, explore, and engage with various Caribbean-based events and activities happening across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and Southern Ontario. The absence of a centralized platform for these events limits visibility and engagement within the Caribbean community. This app will bridge this gap, promoting cultural events and enhancing community engagement.

The app will provide a curated list of upcoming events, advanced filtering and search capabilities, detailed event information, and social sharing features. The project will be carried out in phases, starting with requirements gathering and initial design, followed by development and testing.
